# Step 3: Set Variables
* In a text editor of your choice, open the [environment variables file](https://github.com/IBM/Ansible-OpenShift-Provisioning/blob/main/inventories/default/group_vars/all.yaml).
* This is the master variables file and you will likely reference it many times throughout the process. The default inventory can be found at [inventories/default/group_vars/all.yaml](https://github.com/IBM/Ansible-OpenShift-Provisioning/blob/main/inventories/default/group_vars/all.yaml).
* Fill out the variables marked with `X` to match your specific installation. 
* This is the most important step in the process. Take the time to make sure everything here is correct.
